## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## There will be 4 files in this LAB03:
* RunnableThreadTest1.java - *the main application for running 3 threads*
* RunnableThreadTest2.java - *modified application for running 2 threads*
* PrintNameRunnable.java - *the class for printing, implementing Runnable*
* MyOwnRunnableClass.java - *modified class for printing, implementing Runnable*
