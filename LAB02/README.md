## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## There will be 4 files in this LAB01:
* ExtendThreadClassTest.java - *the main application for running thread*
* ExtendThreadClassTest2.java - *modified application for running thread*
* PrintNameThread.java - *the actual class for printing the name of the threads*
* PrintNameThread2.java - *modified class for printing the name of the threads*
